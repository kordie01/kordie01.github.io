<h1>Why I Won't Do Homework Late Again</h1>
<p> I had completely forgotten about the assignment on the D-day of submission. I quickly rushed to YouTube as any normal Gen-Z would do. Trying to make my work stand out from the others, I decided not to use the common free hosting servers everyone else was using GitHub-pages and tiiny.com. After wasting over an hour trying Google Firebase, I told myself "Boy, just do it". I finally gave up on being different and decided to use GitHub pages. finally done and planning to submit, mandem lock the group. My heart shattered and then I regretted my time not redeemed. luckily after a few minutes, being such a good man, sir reopened the group and within seconds, I had submitted my work. However, the story started before that.</p><br/>
